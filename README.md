# PHPMailer_SMTP-Gmail_ContactFormSampleScript
Send Email From a Contact Form to Your GMail with PHPMailer and SMTP

You can watch the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-z5WaXJ68&t=246s

If you're no longer able to use your localhost to forward contact form data, try using PHPMailer to send email to your preferred destination through an intermediary simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP).
* As always, I recommend watching my videos at 1.25x or 1.50x * =)
